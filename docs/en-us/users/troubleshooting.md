# Issue Feedback Guidelines

Before submitting an Issue, please be sure to read the following content, which will greatly improve the efficiency of problem resolution.

## 1. Core Principles

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> **Please update to the latest version first**! Many issues may have been fixed in the latest version.

## 2. Collect Necessary Information (Required)

When submitting a Bug Report, you **must** provide the following information:

### 📂 Logs

- **Location**: `debug` folder.
    - Tip: Click the 🗄️ icon in the upper right corner of the "Run Logs" panel to export directly.
- **Action**: Please upload the exported `MaaEnd-logs-xxx.zip` file.
    - ❌ Do not copy and send the text content.
    - ❌ Do not take screenshots of the logs.

### 🖼️ Key Screenshots

1. **Software Interface**: A full screenshot of the software interface when the problem occurred.
2. **Version Information**: A screenshot of the version information in the `Settings` -> `Debug` page.

## 3. Special Cases (Optional)

### 👁️ Recognition Issues (Missed Clicks/Wrong Clicks)

1. Enable **"Save Debug Images"** in the settings.
2. Attempt to reproduce the issue again.
3. Upload the debug images generated in the `debug/vision/` directory.
4. If the files are too large to upload, you can upload them to the QQ Group File (1082597011) and note the specific file name in the issue.
5. Remember to turn this off after feedback-otherwise, your hard drive might crash (for real 😉).

### 💥 Program Crashes (Unexpected Exit)

If the program disappears directly or pops up an error box, please try to provide the Crash Dump files:

- **Path**: `C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Local\CrashDumps\` and `C:\CrashDumps`
- **Files**: The recently generated `.dmp` files.
