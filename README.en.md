## 📖 Notes

This project is **under rapid development**, so you may occasionally encounter small bugs 🐛 (we are working hard to squash them!).

If you run into any issues, feel free to open an [ISSUE](https://github.com/MaaEnd/MaaEnd/issues). We will look into it as soon as possible. More fun features are on the way, stay tuned ✨

> 💡 **Tip**: MaaEnd will auto-update to newer versions. No manual update is required.

## ✨ Features

- 🎁 **One‑click preset scenes**: Daily routines, quick claiming rewards, AFK assistance, trading & reselling, Ling Su leveling, and more. Common scenarios can be switched with a single click to save configuration time.
- 🎮 **Real‑time early‑game assistant**: On‑screen recognition with just‑in‑time automation to handle key operations so you can focus on playing.
    - **Auto story**: Skip dialogues, intelligently choose branches, and fast‑forward story segments in one click (or enjoy the story slowly if you prefer).
    - **Interaction handling**: Auto click guidance cursors, flip manuals/pages, tap to continue, close archive voice, and more — no more frantic clicking.
    - **Combat assistance**: Auto basic attacks, skills, ultimates, and chains; supports target locking and focus fire to make battles easier.
    - **Auto loot**: Pick up every shiny drop and gathering point automatically so you never miss any resources.
    - **Convenience actions**: Instant teleport confirmations, auto zipline usage, and faster traversal.
    - **Puzzle helper**: Encounter a puzzle while exploring? Let the AI solve it in seconds (you can also enable the looped "🧩 Auto Puzzle Solver").
    - **Auto petting**: Automatically pet mounts/animals; works great together with auto loot (we suggest switching mounts quickly after petting).
- 🧩 **Puzzle Master**: AI solves puzzles with high accuracy. Supports single run, loop, and demo mode (watch and learn how it solves them).
- 💎 **Matrix recognition**: Smart recognition of matrix affixes, automatically keeping optimal stats and clearing junk in one go.
- 🔫 **Armory upgrade & assembly**: Automate weapon enhancement and gear assembly to free your hands and boost power easily.
- 💰 **Semi‑auto trading/reselling**: Automatically identify and buy the most profitable goods, auto visit friends' ships, and optionally auto switch instances. (Selling still requires manual operation for now.)
- 🛒 **One‑click product selling**: Automatically exchange products at bases into coupons/vouchers; let MaaEnd handle the repetitive clicking.
- 💳 **Credit shop purchasing**: Auto‑buy credit shop items based on your configured wish list so you can "AFK shop" safely.
- 🐌 **Inventory transfer**: Move warehouse stock across regions on the Di Jiang ship in one batch (batteries/ore/sand leaves etc.).
- 🔨 **Batch simple crafting**: Select items in simple crafting and let MaaEnd handle batch production (remember to clear some bag space first).
- 📐 **Blueprint porter**: A boon for builders. Batch import blueprints, parse share codes or messy text intelligently, and set up industrial lines at high efficiency.
- 🎁 **Base tasks**: Automatically collect base outputs, restock, and manage clues (collect/place in one go). Clue exchanging can also be automated (though we do not strongly recommend toggling it on).
- 👥 **Batch friend requests**: Send friend requests in bulk by UID instead of entering them one by one manually.
- 📅 **Daily automation**: Clear daily rewards in one click (missions/battle pass/mail/storage, simulation space rewards, encyclopedia notifications, simple handbook rewards, Baker dialogues, friend visits, etc.).
- 🚚 **Commission secretary**: Automatically accept and forward delivery commissions (toggle by region). Supports "snatching" commissions from the list.
- 💻 **Multi‑platform support**: Works on PC (Win32 API) and Android (ADB), so you can enjoy MaaEnd wherever you play.
